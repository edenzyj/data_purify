Newly generated sequences from each isolate were blasted against the GenBank non-redundant database, restricting searches to type materials for the initial determination of the closest matching species and species complex. Related gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT) from recent publications were downloaded from GenBank. For each gene, sequences from isolates belonging to the same species complex were aligned using the MAFFT v7 online server (https://ma.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). The aligned sequences were manually edited using MEGA v10 to enhance the alignment. The post-alignment sequences of multiple genes/loci were concatenated in a text editor.
To date, several species within the C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, C. magnum, and C. orchidearum complexes have been associated with papaya anthracnose, indicating that more than two Colletotrichum species are involved. It is important to note that C. capsici is now considered a synonym of C. truncatum and is no longer used in many publications. In Australia, C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, and C. queenslandicum have been described in relation to papaya, while C. siamense has been identified in South Africa and China. In India, multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has revealed several species associated with papaya anthracnose, including C. karstii, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and C. salsolae. Most of the reported species are not host-specific and can be found in various locations within papaya-producing countries.

Scientific article 2724 of the West Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station discusses research on enhancing storage quality and reducing decay in apples through calcium supplementation. Accepted for publication on 13 July 1999, this study focuses on the postharvest environment (6–10). Few studies have explored the potential role of calcium supplementation during the preharvest period for disease reduction. The trials aimed to determine whether the use of calcium salts affected fungal growth and disease incidence, both in vitro and in vivo.

The viruses were serologically identical in reciprocal gel diffusion tests and incited similar symptoms in extensive host range studies. This is the first report of TAV in Arkansas. The isolate is considered to be identical to R. tac-Smith H. Tramaie. The publication costs of these articles were defrayed in part by page charge payments. These articles must therefore be marked "advertisement" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 1734 solely to indicate this fact.

The initial concept of a registration system, which involved sending copies of publications to a documentation center, was discussed during a nomenclature meeting in 1954 (Hawksworth 1992). Subsequent proposals were formulated between 1991 and 1998 (Brummitt et al. 1986, Greuter & von Raab-Straube 1998).
The responsibility for submitting details of proposed nomenclatural novelties rests with the authors. This process is envisioned as a practice imposed on authors by high-quality journals, similar to the current incorporation of GenBank accession numbers. If the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) were to be modified, this could become a mandatory requirement. The date for priority purposes will remain the date of effective publication, assuming the name complies with all requirements for valid publication.

Since ICARDA’s inception, the Soil-Plant Analysis Laboratory has played a vital role in the research activities of the Natural Resource Management Program (NRMP) and across the Center. ICARDA management has consistently supported the Soil-Plant Laboratory; without this support, the publication of this manual, which outlines adapted soil and plant analysis procedures, would not have been possible. We thank readers who noted errors in the first two editions of this manual and those who provided suggestions for improvement.
ICARDA welcomes comments and feedback on this publication. Please respond to info@icarda.org.

The USDA breeding program has produced promising selections from this cooperative work, including ‘NC 3874’ and ‘NC 3892’ for the coastal plain of North Carolina; ‘MDUS 4787’, ‘MDUS 5122’, ‘MDUS 5130’, ‘NJ 8123-5’, and ‘NJ 8219-2’ for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions; and hardy selections for the North, such as ‘MNUS 99’, ‘MNUS 52’, ‘MNUS 37’, ‘NY 113’, ‘WIUS 8284’, and ‘WI 8289’. New day-neutral selections, including ‘EB 411’, ‘EB 457’, and ‘EB 460’, which exhibit multiple disease resistance, also show promise.
The USDA strawberry breeding program was initiated with clear, definable objectives aimed at developing cultivars adapted to the environmental conditions of different regions, and it continues to maintain these objectives.
