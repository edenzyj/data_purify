Colletotrichum niense is phylogenetically close to both subspecies of C. kahawae, but it is clearly differentiated based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses. Thus, it represents a new species within the C. kahawae clade in the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Cannon et al., 2000).
Cannon, PF, Buddie AG, and Bridge PD (2008) provided insights into the typification of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in their study published in Mycotaxon (104: 189–204). Additionally, C. hystricis, which is closely related to Citrus hystrix, was isolated from lesions cultivated on leaves and is known for its pleasant smell, being referred to as medicinal lime (Yaacob & Subhadrabandhu, 1995). While the fruit is not widely appreciated, it holds economic importance for the extraction of essential oils, often used in cooking and cosmetics (Allen, 1967).
Colletotrichum hystricis is distinct from C. alienum, which is commonly associated with cultivated fruits (Weir et al., 2012). In the present study, C. hystricis is described as a distinct taxon, supported by morphological differences such as the presence of obovoidal conidia and a slower growth rate in culture. Notably, C. alienum is characterized by the development of perithecia in culture, which the two strains of C. hystricis did not produce on artificial media in this study.
Various studies highlight the significance of Colletotrichum species in agriculture. Crouch et al. (2009) discussed anthracnose disease caused by the novel species Colletotrichum navitas, while Damm et al. (2013) addressed the Colletotrichum orbiculare species complex, which affects field crops and weeds. Other works by Damm et al. (2012) explored the Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum boninense species complexes.
Further research emphasizes the need for effective fungal identification to secure global food and fiber supplies (Crous et al., 2016a). Crous et al. have also contributed significantly to fungal biodiversity literature and the description of new fungal species in various journals, outlining the ongoing developments in mycology.
