This potential effector-triggered immunity might be repressed in this susceptible interaction. Moriwaki et al. (2009) announced a further genome project for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The project is a collaboration between CABI (CABI Europe-UK, Egham, UK) and The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC), Norwich, UK (<tgac.bbsrc.ac.uk>), to carry out a whole genome sequence of the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878). The DNA sequencing phase is nearing completion, and they are about to begin the assembly process.
The meeting provided substantial evidence of the rapid advancement in our understanding of Colletotrichum genomics. This progress was nicely complemented by outputs from another Colletotrichum workshop held earlier in 2010, in conjunction with the 10th European Conference on Fungal Genetics in Leeuwenhorst, the Netherlands. It was particularly exciting to witness the increasing power of genomic research tools and their potential impact on our understanding of fungal interactions.
Perfect et al. (1999) described Colletotrichum as a model genus for studies on pathology and fungal-plant interactions.
Tanaka et al. (2009) investigated how the Colletotrichum orbiculare ssd1 mutant enhances plant basal resistance through the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
Phoulivong et al. (2010) noted that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is not a common pathogen on tropical fruits.
Weir and Johnston (2010) characterized and neotypified Gloeosporium kaki Hori as Colletotrichum horii nom. nov.
These contributions reflect a diverse range of studies addressing the ecology and interactions of Colletotrichum, underscoring its significance in plant pathology.
