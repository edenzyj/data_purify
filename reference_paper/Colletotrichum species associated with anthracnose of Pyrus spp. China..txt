Studies in filamentous ascomycetes have contributed significantly to mycology. In "Mycologia," Kanchana-udomkan et al. (2004) developed a bioassay to study anthracnose infection caused by Colletotrichum capsici in Capsicum chinense Jacq. Choi et al. (1999) focused on single spore isolation of fungi. Crous et al. (2009) compiled important findings in "Fungal Biodiversity," published in the CBS Laboratory Manual Series by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, Netherlands.
Katoh and Standley (2013) introduced improvements in MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software (version 7), enhancing performance and usability for molecular biology research (Molecular Biology and Evolution 30: 772–780). Da Lio et al. (2017) reported the first occurrence of pear bitter rot caused by Colletotrichum fioriniae in France (Plant Disease 101: 1319).
Damm et al. (2013) described the Colletotrichum orbiculare species complex, which includes significant pathogens of field crops and weeds. Further studies by Damm et al. (2012) and Li et al. (2013) explored the Colletotrichum boninense and Colletotrichum fructicola species complexes, respectively, with Li et al. identifying the latter as responsible for bitter rot of pear in China (Plant Disease 97: 1000).
Lima et al. (2013) identified five Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose in northeastern Brazil (Fungal Diversity 61: 75–88). Damm et al. (2014) investigated the Colletotrichum destructivum species complex, while Lin et al. (2002) conducted genetic analyses on resistance to pepper anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum capsici.
Further insights into the diversity of Colletotrichum species and their implications for plant biosecurity were presented by De Silva et al. (2017). Dean et al. (2012) highlighted the top ten fungal pathogens in molecular plant pathology, underscoring their significance.
Diao et al. (2017) documented Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili peppers in China, while Douanla-Meli et al. (2018) conducted a multi-approach analysis of the diversity within Colletotrichum cliviae sensu lato.
