Sharma G, Kumar N, Weir BS, Hyde KD, and Shenoy BD (2013) found that the ApMat marker can resolve Colletotrichum species, as illustrated in a case study with Mangifera indica, documented in Fungal Diversity (61: 117-138).
Sharma G, Pinnaka AK, and Shenoy BD (2014) investigated the infra-specific diversity of Colletotrichum truncatum associated with chili anthracnose in India through microsatellite marker analysis, published in Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection (47: 2509-2523).
Sharma G and Shenoy BD (2014) reported on the involvement of Colletotrichum fructicola and C. siamense in chili anthracnose in India, also found in Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection (47: 1179-1194).
