A three-year survey of declining stands of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in Alabama revealed several associated diseases. The main issues included crown rot caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum and Rhizoctonia solani, along with summer anthracnose (Colletotrichum trifolii), black stem and leaf spot (Cercospora medicaginis), charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina), and nematode infestations affecting seedling stands. Notably, rust (Uromyces striatus) and nematode crown rot were reported for the first time in the state. Of the 15 Rhizoctonia solani isolates collected, 11 were pathogenic on seedling alfalfa. Additionally, six other fungi and eight nematodes were linked to alfalfa health issues.
Historically, alfalfa production in Alabama peaked at 2,000 hectares in the early 1950s but drastically declined by the late 1950s due to the introduction of the alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica). However, since 1975, alfalfa acreage has steadily increased, with current estimates around 1,200 hectares, and plans for further expansion. Alfalfa is impacted by at least 70 different pathogens, with approximately 30 known to significantly limit its production.
Economic control of alfalfa diseases is typically achieved through plant resistance. An alfalfa breeding program is currently underway at Auburn University. Additionally, several private seed companies have expressed interest in developing alfalfa cultivars specifically for the Southern region. Identifying and assessing the major diseases affecting alfalfa in the state will not only assist in making informed selections of available varieties but will also provide essential information regarding the disease resistance that should be incorporated into cultivars developed for Alabama and its neighboring areas. The purpose of this paper is to update the information presented in Plant Disease, November 1980.
