The virulence diversity of anthracnose pathogens, specifically Colletotrichum acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes, has been studied across eight olive cultivars commonly grown in Portugal. The work by Peres et al. (2005) highlighted the life cycles of C. acutatum, while Talhinhas et al. (2011) examined the epidemiology, histopathology, and aetiology of olive anthracnose caused by these pathogens. Perfect et al. (1999) identified Colletotrichum as a model genus for studies in pathology and fungal-plant interactions.
Prusky et al. (2013) discussed the quiescent and necrotrophic lifestyle choices of these fungi during postharvest disease development. They emphasized how these lifestyle choices influence disease outcomes. The distinct population structure of Colletotrichum species associated with olive anthracnose in the Algarve region reflects a complex host-pathogen relationship.
Further investigations by Queiroz et al. (2017) focused on molecular and phenotypic analyses that revealed associations of diverse Colletotrichum groups and a low level of C. gloeosporioides with olive anthracnose. In their work, they detailed the draft genome sequences of two isolates of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of anthracnose in common beans.
Redman et al. (2001) explored the evolution of fungal symbiosis, discussing the transition from mutualism to parasitism and questioning who controls the outcome of this relationship—host or invader? Vargas et al. (2012) provided insights into plant defense mechanisms activated during both biotrophic and necrotrophic stages of Colletotrichum graminicola development in maize.
Additionally, Wharton and Diéguez-Uribeondo (2004) discussed the biology of Colletotrichum acutatum, contributing to the understanding of its role in plant pathology. Lastly, Monod et al. (2016) highlighted the highly conserved nature of certain genes across various species, indicating their potential importance in pathogenicity.
